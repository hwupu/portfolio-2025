# Experience with Shadcn/vue

## tl;dr

This is not a hate post. Instead, a documentary on the journey to Shadcn.

## Problems I faced

I spent a lot of time in the past years “hand-crafting” UI components. It wasn’t just about making them *pixel-perfect*, but also about ensuring compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This was a recurring challenge across various projects using different frontend frameworks, often under tight time constraints.

I felt that most of my time was wasted re-implementing the same components over and over—for React, Vue, and even jQuery. Around 2022, I came across the concept of *headless* UI libraries, such as [Zag](https://github.com/chakra-ui/zag) and [React Aria](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum), which provide basic UI functionality with the flexibility to customize styles. I successfully completed a few projects using them. However, the components I developed for React or Vue still felt too framework-specific and couldn’t be reused across projects.

Thanks to the magic of social media algorithms—especially content from [Fireship](https://youtu.be/TBIjgBVFjVI) and [Theo—t3.gg](https://youtu.be/AqmMx_JidGo) was introduced to **shadcn/ui**, a “not-a-component-library” approach to developing customized component libraries.
